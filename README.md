# Daily Frame

> **One-line pitch:** For anyone tired of performing their life on social media: take one photo a day, write one honest reflection, and keep it just for yourself.

- **Builder:** Michelle (`@mt6254`)
- **Pod:** [Pod Name / Number]
- **Product Page & Living PRD:** https://building-with-ai-f26.github.io/mt6254-daily-frame/
- **App:** runs locally through Week 4; add a cloud URL in Build 5.

## Start here: Build 1

**Due Monday, November 9 at noon, New York time.** No class November 3; keep building that week.

1. Join the [class organization](https://github.com/building-with-ai-f26), then use this template to create a **public** repo named `<netid>-<project-slug>`. Ask Christian or Hew if the organization is missing from the owner list.
2. Set up Git and one coding agent during the week of October 27. Follow the [Icerynk setup guide](https://www.icerynk.com/c/fa26-tech-gb-2160-dm2-f2/content/pre-class-setup-github-openrouter-your-coding-agent).
3. Publish [`docs/index.html`](./docs/index.html): **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → /docs → Save**. When deployment finishes, open `https://building-with-ai-f26.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.
4. Fill in PRD v1: a reachable user, their painful before/after workflow, one core workflow, and three non-goals.
5. Build a rough local prototype. Add a screenshot or GIF and an honest Build 1 log to the Product Page, including progress, learning, problems, costs, and hours.
6. Push meaningful commits on **at least two separate days each week outside class**, including the November 3 break.
7. Submit your **Product Page URL and repository URL in Icerynk**. Come ready to demo the prototype in two minutes on November 10.

Create your PostHog account in Week 1. Install it on the Product Page and local app in **Build 2**, then verify events. The Product Page is public from Build 1; the app can stay local through Week 4.

## Local setup

No installs, accounts, or API keys needed. You only need Python 3 (preinstalled on macOS) and a browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/building-with-ai-f26/mt6254-daily-frame.git
cd mt6254-daily-frame/app
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000. Tap a day, add a photo, and write a reflection. Everything saves automatically in your browser on this computer; nothing is uploaded.

If your app needs API keys, use a local environment file such as `.env`. Keep private keys out of source code, browser code, screenshots, and commits. The template ignores `.env`; `.env.example` contains placeholders only.
